(* ------------------------------------------------ *)

(* Elpi is an embedded λProlog interpreter.
   λProlog is a programming language designed to
   manipulate syntax trees containing binders.

   coq-elpi, this software, is embedding elpi
   in Coq as a scripting language.

   In CoqIDE please chose &quot;coq-elpi&quot; in

     Edit -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Colors

   to have proper syntax highlight of the
   following text.

   This little tutorial does not talk about Coq.
   It just uses Coq as an environment in which
   λProlog programs can be defined and run,
   
*)

(* 
   We begin by introducing the first order fragment of
   λProlog, i.e. the terms will not contains binders.
   We then introduce the constructs to deal with binders.



   A λProlog program is made of clauses that declare
   when a predicate holds.

   For example the next commands &quot;accumulates&quot; on top
   of the current program a bunch of clauses describing
   the age of 3 individuals.
*)

Elpi Accumulate &quot;
 age mallory 23.
 age alice 20.
 age bob 23.
&quot;.

(* Note about the syntax:
   - Variables are identifiers starting with a capital letter
   - constants (for individuals or predicates) are identifiers
     starting with a lowercase letter

   The entry point (main) of a program is a query,
   i.e. an expression containing variables as
     `age alice X`
   and the execution of the program assigns X to the
   age of alice.
*)
Elpi Query &quot;
  age alice A.
&quot;.

(* `age` is also said to be a relation (in contrast to
   a function), since it `computes` both ways.
*)

Elpi Query &quot;
  age P 23, coq-say P, coq-say &quot;&quot;is 23&quot;&quot;.
&quot;.

(* A query as `age P 23` is unified with each
   and every clause. Unification compares two
   terms structurally and eventually assigns variables.

   For example for the first clause of the program we obtain
   the following unification problem

     age P 23 = age mallory 23

   that is simplified into smaller equations following
   the structure of the terms

     age = age
     P = mallory
     23 = 23

   The second can be satisfied by assigning mallory to P.
   All equations are solved, hence unification succeeds.
   Note that the = sign is part of the syntax.  The query

     age P 23

   can be rewritten as

     A = 23, age P A

   See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_(computer_science)#Syntactic_unification_of_first-order_terms


   The first part of the query is succesful and the rest of
   the query is run: the value of P is printed as well as
   the &quot; is 23&quot; string.

   What happens when unification fails?

*)

Elpi Query &quot;
  age P 20, coq-say P, coq-say &quot;&quot;is 20&quot;&quot;.
&quot;.

(* Once again the unification problem for the first clause
   in the program is

     age P 20 = age mallory 23

   that is simplified into smaller equations following
   the structure of the terms

     age = age
     P = mallory
     20 = 23

   The second equation assigns P, but the third one fails.

   When failure occurs, the next clause in the program is
   tried and all assignements are undo, i.e. P is fresh again.
   This operation is called backtracking.

   The unification problem for the next clause is:

     age P 20 = age bob 23

   This one also fails.  The last one is:

     age P 20 = age alice 20

   This one works, and the assigment P = alice is kept as the result
   of the first part of the query.

*)

Elpi Query &quot;age P A, age Q A, not(P = Q),
          coq-say P, coq-say &quot;&quot;and&quot;&quot;, coq-say Q, coq-say &quot;&quot;are&quot;&quot;, coq-say A
&quot;.

(* Backtracking is global.  The first solution for
   age P A and age Q A are the same, but then not(P = Q),
   by failing when both P and Q are mallory, forces the last
   choice that was made to be reconsidered, so Q becomes bob.

   Look at the outout of the following instrumented code:
*)

Elpi Query &quot;age P A, age Q A, coq-say &quot;&quot;attempt&quot;&quot;, coq-say P, coq-say Q,
          not(P = Q),
          coq-say &quot;&quot;the last one worked!&quot;&quot;,
          coq-say P, coq-say &quot;&quot;and&quot;&quot;, coq-say Q, coq-say &quot;&quot;are&quot;&quot;, coq-say A
&quot;.

(* Clauses may have premises, for example older P Q
   requires the age of P to be greater than the age of Q. *)
Elpi Accumulate &quot;
  older P Q :- age P N, age Q M, N &gt; M.
&quot;.

(* Let&#39;s run a query using older *)

Elpi Query &quot;older bob X, coq-say &quot;&quot;bob is older than&quot;&quot;, coq-say X.&quot;.

(* The query older bob X is unified with the head of
   the program clause older P Q, assigning P = bob
   and X = Q.  Then new queries are run
     age bob N
     age Q M
     N &gt; M
   The former assigns N = 23, the second one first
   sets Q = mallory and M = 23.  This makes the last
   query to fail, since 23 &gt; 23 is false.  Hence the
   second query is run again and again until Q is
   set to alice and M to 20. 
*)

(* Variables in the query are said to be existentially
   quantified because λProlog will try to find one
   possible value for them.

   Conversely, the variables used in clauses are
   universally quantified in the front of the clause.
   This means that the program same clause can be used
   multiple times, and each time the variables are fresh.
*)

(* So far the syntax of terms is based on constants
   (eg age or mallory) and variables (eg X).

   λProlog adds to that λ-abstraction
   (written x\...) to build functions.  Such
   functions, when applied, honor the β-reduction
   rule.

   In the following example F 23 reads, once
   the β-reduction is performed, age alice 23.
*)
Elpi Query &quot;
  F = (x\ age alice x),
  F 20, not(F 23).
&quot;.

(* Let&#39;s write the hello world of λProlog, an
   interpreter and type checker for the simply
   typed lambda calculus.

   Elpi&#39;s implementation of λProlog is untyped:
   types play no role in computation.  Still one
   can give type annotations, to improve readability
   and to gide the elpy type checker to find simple
   mistakes.

*)

Elpi Accumulate &quot;
  kind  term  type.
&quot;.

(* &quot;term&quot; is a new data type.  We then give
   two term constructors: &quot;app&quot; and &quot;lam&quot;.
   We also give their types, &quot;app&quot; takes two terms
   while &quot;lam&quot; only one (of functional type).
*)

Elpi Accumulate &quot;
  type  app   term -&gt; term -&gt; term.
  type  lam   (term -&gt; term) -&gt; term.
&quot;.

(* Note that:
   - there is no constructor for variables, we will 
     use the notion of bound variable of λProlog
   - &quot;lam&quot; takes a function as subterm, i.e. something
     we can build using the λ-abstraction x\...

   The identity function is hence written
     lam (x\ x)
   While the &quot;fst&quot; function is written
     lam (x\ lam (y\ x))

   This approach is called HOAS:
     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_abstract_syntax
*)

(* The interpreter performs weak head reduction, i.e. it stops when
   the terms is a &quot;lam&quot; (or a constant).
   If the term is (app (lam F) A) then it computes the reduct (F A).
   Note that F is a λProlog function, so passing an argument to it
   implements the subtitution of the actual argument for the bound variable.
*) 
Elpi Accumulate &quot;
  weakhd (app Hd Arg) Reduct :- weakhd Hd (lam F), weakhd (F Arg) Reduct.
  weakhd X X. % a term X is already in normal form.
&quot;.

(* A little test using constants *)
Elpi Accumulate &quot;
  type foo, bar term.
&quot;.
Elpi Query &quot;
  Fst = lam (x\ lam y\ x),
  T = app (app Fst foo) bar,

  S = app foo bar,
  weakhd S S1, coq-say &quot;&quot;weakhd of S is&quot;&quot;, coq-say S1.

  % for the app node we test the head is a function from
  % A to B, and that the argument is of type A
  of (app Hd Arg) B :-
    of Hd (arr A B), of Arg A.

  % for lambda, instead of using a context (a list) of bound
  % variables we use the pi and =&gt; primitives, explained below
  of (lam F) (arr A B) :-
    pi x\ of x A =&gt; of (F x) B.
&quot;.

(* &quot;pi &lt;name&gt;\ &lt;code&gt;&quot; is a reserved syntax, as well as
   &quot;&lt;code&gt; =&gt; &lt;code&gt;&quot;.
   Operationally &quot;pi x\ code&quot; introduces a fresh
   constant x and then runs code.
   Operationally &quot;clause =&gt; code&quot; adds &quot;clause&quot; to 
   the program and runs code.  Such extra clause is
   said to be hypothetical.
   Both &quot;x&quot; and &quot;clause&quot; are removed once &quot;code&quot; terminates.

   Note that the hypothetical clause is &quot;of x A&quot; for
   a fixed A (but still not assigned A) and a fresh
   constant x.
*)

Elpi Query &quot;
  of (lam (x\ lam y\ x)) Ty, coq-say &quot;&quot;The type is&quot;&quot;, coq-say Ty.
&quot;.

(* Let&#39;s run step by step this example.

  The clause for lam is used:
  - Ty is assigned (arrow A1 B1)
  - a fresh c1 is created by the pi construct
  - of c1 A1 is added to the program by the =&gt; construct,
  - the new query of (lam y\ c1) B1 is run.

  Again, the clause for lam is used (since its variables are
  universally quantified, we use new A2, B2... instead):
  - B1 is assigned (arrow A2 B2)
  - a fresh c2 is created by the pi construct
  - of c2 A2 is added to the program by the =&gt; construct,
  - the new query of c1 B2 is run.

  The (hypotetical) clause of c1 A1 is used:
  - B2 gets assigned to A1

  The value of Ty is hence (arr A1 (arr A2 A1)), a good type
  for the fst function (the first argument and the output
  have the same type A1).

*)

Fail Elpi Query &quot;
  Delta = lam (x\ app x x),
  of Delta Ty, coq-say Ty.
&quot;.

(* The term `lam (x\ app x x)` is not well typed:

  The clause for lam is used:
  - Ty is assigned (arrow A1 B1)
  - a fresh c1 is created by the pi construct
  - of c1 A1 is added to the program by the =&gt; construct,
  - the new query of (app c1 c1) B1 is run.
  The clause for app is used:
  - the query of c1 (arr A2 B2) assigned to A1 the
    value (arr A2 B2).  This means that the
    hypothetical clause is now of c1 (arr A2 B2).
  - the query of c1 A2 fails because
    A2 = (arr A2 B2) has no solution
*)

(* The semantics of a λProlog program is given by interpreting
   it in terms of logical formulas and proof search.

   A clause
     p A B :- q A C, r C B.
   has to be understood as a formula
     ∀A B C, (q A C /\ r C B) =&gt; p A B

   A query is a goal that is proved by backchaining
   clauses.  For example `p 3 X`
   is solved by unifying it with the conclusion of
   the formula above (that sets A to 3) and 
   generating two new queries, `q 3 C` and
   `r C B`. Note that `C` is an argument to both
   `q` and `r` and acts as a link: if solving `q`
   fixes `C` then the query for `r` sees that.
   Similarly for `B`, that is identified with X,
   and is hence a link from the solution of `r` to
   the solution of `p`.

   A clause like
     of (lam F) (arr A B) :-
       pi x\ of x A =&gt; of (F x) B.
   reads
     ∀F A B, (∀x, of x A =&gt; of (F x) B) =&gt; of (lam F) (arr A B).
   Hence, &quot;x&quot; and &quot;of x A&quot; are available only
   temporarily to prove  &quot;of (F x) B&quot; and this is
   also why &quot;A&quot; cannot change during such proof (A is
   quantified once and forall outside).

   Each program execution is a proof of the query
   and is made of the program clauses seen as axioms.

(* ------------------------------------------------ *)

(* Wrap up

   The simple interpreter and type checker for
   the lambda calculus shows how easy it is to
   manipulate syntax trees with binders in λProlog.

   This piece of software (coq-elpi) embeds in Coq
   the ELPI λProlog interpreter and exposes the
   Coq datatype of terms to such scripting language.

   In addition to that it exposes to the scripting
   language a few basic API to query the environment
   of data types and constants as well as to add to
   such environment terms built by a λProlog program.

 *)

(* ------------------------------------------------ *)

(* Extensions to λProlog implemented in Elpi

   Elpi extends λProlog with syntactic constraints
   and rules to manipulate the set of constraints.

   Syntactic constraints are goals suspended on
   a variable and are resumed as soon as such variable
   gets instantiated.

   A companion facility is the declaration of modes.
   The argument of a predicate can be marked as input
   to avoid it being instantiated when unifying the
   the goal with the head of a clause.
